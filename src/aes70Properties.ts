 * default for every option when an action is created, and nothing for an option added
 * to the definition afterwards: such an option would reach the action as `false`, as an
 * empty string, or fail validation, instead of the default the editor shows.
 *
 * Types come from each property's encoder in aes70: the primitive encoders by identity,
 * and an enum by the member values its encoder exposes. Both are aes70 implementation
 * details, so aes70Properties.spec.ts pins them against real aes70 classes.
